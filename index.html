 <h2>VOID TOKEN</h2>
  All tokens have been distributed for free. <p>
	What is a VoidToken? An experiment where free tokens are distributed but they lose 5% on each transfer.<p>
	 Send them on to someone else and watch as the supply is affected. This is an experiement to test tokens<p>
	that deflate in supply when transferred. Void was freely sent out. Don't expect the Void you receive to be<p>
	worth any actual money or value, these are just tokens for what amounts to an interesting game/experiment.
