 -1. THE VOID AIRDROP HAS ENDED - There was an overwhelming response in the first 24 hours of the coin. To those who applied in the first day, the tokens will be sent out before the end of June 21.<br><br>
0. <font color=blue>How does this work?</font> <br><br> This is an experiment. Void Token (VOID) is an Ethereum based token that loses supply when used. Everytime someone transfers some VOID, 5% of the transfer amount is burned and
   thus the circulating supply becomes smaller. This creates an environment roughly opposite to a traditional currency which has its supply inflated. <br><br>
   
  1. <font color=blue>Why?</font> <br><br> Almost all currencies are inflationary, which chips away at the purchasing power (and wealth) of the middle and lower classes especially. 
   Sometimes it leads to total disaster (think Zimbabwe or Venezuala). What would happen if a token worked in the exact opposite way to a traditionally inflated currency? What if the supply was DEFLATED instead
   of inflated. Would it work at all? Let's find out with this experiment.
   
   <br><br>
   
   2. <font color=blue> What are the details?</font><br><br> Void Token started with a supply of 1 million tokens. Everytime a transfer is made, 5% of the tokens transferred are burnt and removed from the circulating
          supply. This means that instead of the token supply increasing or staying the same over time, it decreases constantly. 
		   <br><br>
  3.  <font color=blue>What are the expectations for this token?</font><br><br> There are none. This is an experiment which is possible thanks to blockchain technology. This token has no metrics that determine success or failure, rather
		it will simply yeild information regarding what happens when supply is deflated instead of inflated. As future generations reject the inflating away of their hard-earned money, they will look to new monetary ideas
		 and solutions. Any datapoints gathered from previous generations will be helpful in making sure they make wiser and more informed choices.
		  <br><br>
		   4. <font color=blue> What about other deflationary tokens?</font><br><br> These other tokens are our inspiration, experiements in the same field which should also be explored. $bombtoken and $halflife depreciate at 1% and 2% respectively. Void token depreciates at a hyper-aggressive 5% per transaction, meaning
				this experiment will simply be another useful datapoint alongside the others.
		  <br><br>
		 5. <font color=blue>How can I take part in this experiment?</font><br><br> Get some Void Tokens today. The entire supply, minus a 5% special airdrop, community and dev account are being given away for free.
<br><br>
	6. <font color=blue>Rules:</font><br><br> Airdrops are 1 per person. Void tokens are not worth any monetary or other value. We do not recomend buying Void Tokens as they are not worth money but are just tokens for an experiment. Just get Void Tokens for free in the airdrop. If something proves wrong with the contract the token can be snapshot and redeployed. No guarantees offered, take part in the experiement at your own risk.
		 <br><br><br><br>
		 
		THE VOID AIRDROP HAS ENDED - to those who sent their addresses on the first day, tokens will be sent out over the next 24 hours.
