 <h2>VOID TOKEN</h2>
  All tokens have been distributed for free. New content coming soon- working on a system that allows you to view content exclusively for Void holders
<br> Important: Void Token doesn't endorse buying or selling the token or listing it on any exchanges. <p>You are responsible for your Ethereum wallet and should keep your keys backed up and in a safe place at all time.
