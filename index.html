 <h2>VOID TOKEN</h2>
  All tokens have been distributed for free. New content coming soon- working on a system that allows you to view content exclusively for Void holders
<br> We don't recomend buying or selling Void Token as ERC20 tokens are easily minted/copied and pasted and are mostly good for running experiments. 
	 Hopefully soon we are able to deploy a system through the site that allows content viewing based on Void holdings, with Void being voided as new content is viewed.
